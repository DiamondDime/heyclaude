# codriver

Talk to **Claude Code** by voice while you drive.

Send a Telegram voice note from your phone; the bot on your Mac transcribes it,
runs it through the `claude` CLI, and replies with a spoken voice note. Claude
works on **your Claude Code subscription** — no paid Anthropic API key required.

```
voice note → Whisper (local) → claude -p --resume → TTS → voice reply
```

Each drive is one continuous conversation: the session id is persisted, so
follow-up requests keep their context.

## Safety — read this first

codriver is a **remote-code-execution channel into your Mac.** Treat it that way.

- It runs `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, so Claude executes commands,
  edits files, and hits the network **without asking for approval.**
- The **only** thing standing between a Telegram message and your machine is the
  single allowed Telegram user ID. There is no second guard. Anyone who can post
  to your bot as that user gets a shell on your Mac.
- A working directory is **not** a sandbox. Claude can read and write outside it.
  Point codriver at a **dedicated, throwaway workspace** — never your home folder
  and never a real repo with secrets, SSH keys, or production code.
- Use a fresh Telegram bot token, keep it out of any directory Claude can reach,
  and rotate it if it is ever exposed.

If that trade-off is not acceptable to you, do not run this.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses the `say` voice and Homebrew `ffmpeg`)
- **ffmpeg** — `brew install ffmpeg`
- A working **Claude Code login** (`claude` on your PATH, already signed in)
- A **Telegram bot** token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and your
  numeric user id from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
- Python **3.11+**
- Optional: an **ElevenLabs** API key for higher-quality speech

## Install

```bash
pipx install .
```

This installs the `codriver` command.

---

## Set up: `codriver init`

```bash
codriver init
```

The wizard walks you through everything:

1. **Safety notice** — the warning above, up front.
2. **Telegram bot token** — pasted and verified against Telegram (it shows your
   bot's `@username` on success).
3. **Telegram user id** — the numeric id allowed to talk to the bot.
4. **TTS backend** — pick `elevenlabs` or `say` (see below).
5. **Workspace** — defaults to `~/codriver-workspace`. It is created, seeded with
   a `CLAUDE.md`, and initialized as a git repo on a `codriver-work` branch. This
   is the dedicated workspace Claude operates in — keep it separate from anything
   you care about.
6. Writes `~/.config/codriver/config.toml` (permissions `0600`).

Config lives at `~/.config/codriver/config.toml`, outside the repo. You never
have to edit it by hand.

---

## Run: `start` / `stop` / `status`

```bash
codriver start            # start the bot (begins polling Telegram)
codriver start --check    # validate token + TTS credentials, then exit
codriver stop             # stop the running bot
codriver status           # show running (with PID) or stopped
```

`codriver start --check` is the safe pre-flight: it confirms your bot token works
and, if you chose ElevenLabs, that your API key is valid — without going live.

Then put on your seatbelt, open the chat with your bot, and start sending voice
notes.

## Text-to-speech backends

codriver can speak its replies two ways:

- **`say`** — macOS's built-in speech (voice `Samantha`). Zero setup, no account,
  works offline. Robotic but fine.
- **`elevenlabs`** — natural, human-sounding voices. Needs an API key. During
  `codriver init` the bot lists your available ElevenLabs voices so you can pick
  one.

**Get a free ElevenLabs API key: https://try.elevenlabs.io/ihajsceo1jo8**

> That's a referral link — signing up through it supports codriver at no extra
> cost to you. The tool works identically with any ElevenLabs key, or with the
> free local `say` voice, so use whatever you prefer.

## How it works

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `codriver/config.py` | config loading (env > `config.toml` > defaults), whitelist, paths |
| `codriver/stt.py`    | local Whisper transcription |
| `codriver/brain.py`  | runs `claude -p --resume`, keeps session continuity |
| `codriver/tts.py`    | text → spoken OGG/Opus (ElevenLabs or `say`) |
| `codriver/bot.py`    | Telegram handlers and wiring |
| `codriver/cli.py`    | `init` / `start` / `stop` / `status` |

Transcription runs locally with Whisper. Replies are encoded as mono Opus, the
format Telegram voice messages require.

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

The included tests are pure functions — no network, token, or model download.
